\ED

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Backward, forward \& central FD}

\bul For instance, to 1$^{\text{st}}$ order accuracy in $\Delta x$, we have the \textit{1$^{\text{st}}$ order forward difference} :
$$u_{i}'\sim\frac{u_{i+1}-u_{i}}{\Delta x}$$
\iar but we also have the \textit{1$^{\text{st}}$ order backward difference} :
$$u_{i}'\sim\frac{u_{i}-u_{i-1}}{\Delta x}$$
\iar or the \textit{2$^{\text{nd}}$ order central difference} :
$$u_{i}'\sim\frac{u_{i+1}-u_{i-1}}{2\Delta x}$$

\bul Which one to choose? Properties (e.g. stencil, accuracy)?

\ED

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Truncation error and order of accuracy}

\BD

\bul Taylor expansions linking $u_i$ to the continuous function $u$  :
\begin{align}
&u_{i+1}=u\left(0\right)+u'\left(0\right)\Delta x+u''\left(0\right)\frac{\left(\Delta x\right)^2}{2!}+u^{\left(3\right)}\left(0\right)\frac{\left(\Delta x\right)^3}{3!}+... \label{eq:Taylor1}\\
&u_i    =u\left(0\right) \label{eq:Taylor2}\\
&u_{i-1}=u\left(0\right)-u'\left(0\right)\Delta x+u''\left(0\right)\frac{\left(\Delta x\right)^2}{2!}-u^{\left(3\right)}\left(0\right)\frac{\left(\Delta x\right)^3}{3!}+... \label{eq:Taylor3}

\bul Order of accuracy (o.a.) $=$ order of first truncated term
\iar $( \Delta x$-->$\Delta x/2 )$ => accuracy improved by 2$^{\text{o.a.}}$

$$\frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t} = - v \frac{u^n_{i+1}-u^n_{i-1}}{2\Delta x}$$

u^{n+1}_i = u^n_i - v \,{\Dt \over \Dx} \,{u^n_{i+1} - u^n_{i-1} \over2}
\label{eq:explicit}
\end{equation}

\iar 1$^{\text{st}}$ order accurate in time, 2$^{\text{nd}}$ order in space

\iar Is this FD approximation consistent? % yes

\bul \underline{Sandbox:} Write your 1$^{\text{st}}$ solver using the explicit forward 2$^{\text{nd}}$ order central difference above. Apply it to the Riemann problem (advection of a step function). Is the numerical solution stable?

\iar scheme is unconditionally unstable since for all $k$
$$ \bigg|{\epsilon_k^{n+1} \over \epsilon_k^n}\bigg| > 1 $$

\bul 3 possible solutions to stabilize

\bul adding diffusion: advection-\Blue{diffusion} equation has form
$$ \deldelt{u}=-v\,\deldelx{u}+\Blue{{\cal D}\,\deldelxx{u}} \quad \text{with } {\cal D} \text{ a diffusion coefficient}$$

\bul \underline{Lax-Friedrichs scheme :} in \eqref{eq:explicit}, if we replace $\Red{u_i^n}$ by spatial average between $i-1$ and $i+1$, we get :
$$ u^{n+1}_i = \textcolor{red}{u^n_{i+1} + u^n_{i-1} \over 2} - v \,{\Dt \over \Dx} \,{u^n_{i+1} - u^n_{i-1} \over 2} $$
which can be rearranged to form
$$ {u^{n+1}_i -u^n_i\over\Dt}= -v\,{u^n_{i+1} - u^n_{i-1} \over 2\Dx} + {(\Dx)^2 \over 2\Dt} \,{u^n_{i+1} - 2u^n_i + u^n_{i-1} \over (\Dx)^2} $$

\iar limitation of the time step $\Dt$ for a given resolution $\Dx$
