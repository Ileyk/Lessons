\bul round-off errors should not grow during time progression

\iar numerical solution = exact $+$ round-off error $\epsilon(x,t)$
\iar represent $\epsilon(x,t)$ in Fourier series, analyse Fourier term
$$ \epsilon_i^{n}\left(k\right) = \hat{\epsilon}_k {\rm e}^{\lambda t^n} {\rm e}^{{\rm i}kx_i} $$
\bul numerically stable scheme $\forall$ spatial wavenumbers $k$ if
$$  \bigg|{\epsilon_i^{n+1}\left(k\right) \over \epsilon_i^n\left(k\right)}\bigg| = \big| {\rm e}^{\lambda\Dt}\big| \le 1 $$

\bul Assume $N+1$ points regularly spaced by $\Delta x$ and $u_{i}$ the associated values

\bul \underline{Key-question:} how to get a FD approximation of the spatial derivatives $u_{i}'$, $u_{i}''$...? 
\iar Use Taylor series expansions

\ED

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Backward, forward \& central FD}
\BD

\bul For instance, to 1$^{\text{st}}$ order accuracy in $\Delta x$, we have the \textit{1$^{\text{st}}$ order forward difference} :
$$u_{i}'\sim\frac{u_{i+1}-u_{i}}{\Delta x}$$
\iar but we also have the \textit{1$^{\text{st}}$ order backward difference} :
$$u_{i}'\sim\frac{u_{i}-u_{i-1}}{\Delta x}$$
\iar or the \textit{2$^{\text{nd}}$ order central difference} :
$$u_{i}'\sim\frac{u_{i+1}-u_{i-1}}{2\Delta x}$$

\bul Which one to choose? Properties (e.g. stencil, accuracy)?

\ED

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Truncation error and order of accuracy}

\BD

\bul Taylor expansions linking $u_i$ to the continuous function $u$  :
\begin{align}
&u_{i+1}=u\left(0\right)+u'\left(0\right)\Delta x+u''\left(0\right)\frac{\left(\Delta x\right)^2}{2!}+u^{\left(3\right)}\left(0\right)\frac{\left(\Delta x\right)^3}{3!}+... \label{eq:Taylor1}\\
&u_i    =u\left(0\right) \label{eq:Taylor2}\\
&u_{i-1}=u\left(0\right)-u'\left(0\right)\Delta x+u''\left(0\right)\frac{\left(\Delta x\right)^2}{2!}-u^{\left(3\right)}\left(0\right)\frac{\left(\Delta x\right)^3}{3!}+... \label{eq:Taylor3}
\end{align}

\iar \eqref{eq:Taylor1}$-$\eqref{eq:Taylor3} : $u'\left(0\right)=\frac{u_{i+1}-u_{i-1}}{2\Delta x}+\underbrace{O\left(\left(\Delta x\right)^\color{red}{2}\right)}_{\text{truncation error}}$

\bul Order of accuracy (o.a.) $=$ order of first truncated term
\iar $( \Delta x$-->$\Delta x/2 )$ => accuracy improved by 2$^{\text{o.a.}}$

\bul Stencil : points required, increases with o.a.

\BD

\bul Consider the 1D linear advection equation with constant speed $v$ :
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \rho+ v \partial_x \rho =0
\label{eq:lin_adv}
\end{equation}

\bul Explicit time integration: values at t$^{n+1}$ computed from available information on time level t$^n=$t$^{n+1}-\Delta t$

\ED
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Principle}

\BD

\bul \underline{Example:} explicit forward 2$^{\text{nd}}$ order central difference (a.k.a. Euler’s Forward Time Central Space, FTCS)

$$\frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t} = - v \frac{u^n_{i+1}-u^n_{i-1}}{2\Delta x}$$

\iar rearrange to
\begin{equation}
u^{n+1}_i = u^n_i - v \,{\Dt \over \Dx} \,{u^n_{i+1} - u^n_{i-1} \over2}
\label{eq:explicit}
\end{equation}

\iar 1$^{\text{st}}$ order accurate in time, 2$^{\text{nd}}$ order in space

\iar Is this FD approximation consistent? % yes

\bul \underline{Sandbox:} Write your 1$^{\text{st}}$ solver using the Euler's FTCS above (and periodic boundary conditions, $\sim$ infinite simulation space). Apply it to the Riemann problem (advection of a step function). Is the numerical solution stable?

\ED
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Von Neumann stability analysis}

\BD

\bul Balsara 2.7.1

\bul Von Neumann stability analysis
$$ {\rm e}^{\lambda \Dt} = 1 - {v\Dt \over \Dx} \,{{\rm e}^{{\rm i}k\Dx} - {\rm e}^{-{\rm i}k\Dx} \over 2} = 1-{\rm i} \,{v\Dt \over \Dx} \,\sin{(k\Dx)} $$
\iar scheme is unconditionally unstable since for all $k$
$$ \bigg|{\epsilon_k^{n+1} \over \epsilon_k^n}\bigg| > 1 $$

\bul 3 possible solutions to stabilize

\iar add numerical diffusivity to damp nonphysical instability

\iar impose same space-time symmetry as original PDE

\iar use implicit scheme (next section)

\ED

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Numerical diffusivity : the Lax-Friedrichs scheme}

\BD

\bul adding diffusion: advection-\Blue{diffusion} equation has form
$$ \deldelt{u}=-v\,\deldelx{u}+\Blue{{\cal D}\,\deldelxx{u}} \quad \text{with } {\cal D} \text{ a diffusion coefficient}$$

\bul \underline{Lax-Friedrichs scheme :} in \eqref{eq:explicit}, if we replace $\Red{u_i^n}$ by spatial average between $i-1$ and $i+1$, we get :
$$ u^{n+1}_i = \textcolor{red}{u^n_{i+1} + u^n_{i-1} \over 2} - v \,{\Dt \over \Dx} \,{u^n_{i+1} - u^n_{i-1} \over 2} $$
which can be rearranged to form
$$ {u^{n+1}_i -u^n_i\over\Dt}= -v\,{u^n_{i+1} - u^n_{i-1} \over 2\Dx} + {(\Dx)^2 \over 2\Dt} \,{u^n_{i+1} - 2u^n_i + u^n_{i-1} \over (\Dx)^2} $$
\iar numerical dissipation with ${\cal D}\equiv {(\Dx)^2 / 2\Dt}$
\iar 1$^{\text{st}}$ order accurate in time, 2$^{\text{nd}}$ order in space

\BD

\bul perform von Neumann stability analysis for Lax-Friedrichs 
$$ {\rm e}^{\lambda \Dt} = \cos{(k\Dx)}- {\rm i} \,{v\Dt \over \Dx} \,\sin{(k\Dx)} $$
\iar conditional stability requiring Courant number $C$
$$ C \equiv {|v|\Dt \over \Dx} \le 1 $$
\iar limitation of the time step $\Dt$ for a given resolution $\Dx$
\iar Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition (1928)

\bul \underline{Rk:} see stencil of Lax-Friedrichs scheme in Table on slide \ref{fig:FD_explicit_methods}

\frametitle{The Lax-Wendroff scheme}

\BD

\bul Lax-Friedrichs has different o.a. in space (2$^{\text{nd}}$) and time (1$^{\text{st}}$) 
\iar 2$^{\text{nd}}$ order Taylor expansion in time of $u_i(t),$ yields :
\begin{equation}
u_i(t+\Delta t)=u_i(t)+u_i'(t)\Dt+u_i''(t)\frac{(\Dt)^2}{2}
\label{eq:LW}
\end{equation}
\iar \eqref{eq:lin_adv} => $u_i'\sim -v\partial_x u$ 
\iar to find $u_i''$, $\partial_t$\eqref{eq:lin_adv} and (illegaly) switch $\partial_t$ and $\partial_x$ in mixed term :
$$u_i''\sim v^2 \partial_{xx} u $$
\iar finally, reinject in \eqref{eq:LW} and use a central difference for spatial derivatives :
$$ u^{n+1}_i = u^n_i - \half{\Dt \over \Dx}\,v \,(u^n_{i+1} - u^n_{i-1}) + \half {(\Dt)^2 \over (\Dx)^2} \,v^2 \,(u^n_{i+1} - 2 u^n_i + u^n_{i-1}) $$
