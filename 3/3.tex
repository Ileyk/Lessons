\partial_t u + \partial_xf\right)=0
\label{eq:cons_law}
\end{equation}

\bul Average variables $u$ over cell to get $U$ : $\frac{1}{\Dx}\int_{\text{cell}}$\eqref{eq:cons_law}
\iar 1$^{\text{st}}$ order forward in time then gives :
$$\frac{U^{n+1}_i-U^{n}_i}{\Dt}=-\frac{F^{n+1/2}_{i+1/2}-F^{n-1/2}_{i-1/2}}{\Dx}$$
\begin{equation*}
\text{where} \quad 
\left\{\begin{aligned} U^{n}_i=\frac{1}{\Dx}\int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i+1/2}}u\left(x,t^n\right)\Dx\\ 
F^{n+1/2}_{i+1/2}=\text{flux @ interface i+1/2} \xrightarrow \quad \text{unknown}\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

\iar $\sum$ over all cells => fluxes cancel out => conservative

\bul \underline{Key-question:} how do you reconstruct the fluxes @ interfaces?
